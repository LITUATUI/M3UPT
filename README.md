## 👍 Recommended specs for Android TV boxes

For a good experience you need a device with decent SoC and enough RAM. As a general rule avoid SoCs made by Rockchip and Allwinner.

* **SoC**: Amlogic S905W2 (cheap, energy efficient and supports the recent AV1 video codec)
* **RAM**: 4 GB

Affordable Android TV boxes with Amlogic SoCs are usually much better supported than the ones powered by Rockchip or Allwinner. 
You can buy a decent device with the Amlogic S905W2 SoC and 4 GB of RAM for around 50 euros. Visit the recommended shopping websites below if you want to get one.
