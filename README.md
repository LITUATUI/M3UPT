## 🧭 Getting started

All you need to get started is to configure your favorite IPTV player with the M3U link. You don't need to configure the EPG link in most players, because they'll get it automatically from the M3U playlist.

### 🔗 Links to use in your IPTV player

- **M3U**: <https://m3upt.com/iptv>
- **EPG**: <https://m3upt.com/epg>

## 🎬 Recommended IPTV players

To get the best experience, I recommend to use one of the following IPTV players.

---

### 🏆 OTT TV or OTT Navigator IPTV (clones)

Currently, this is the most complete IPTV player and opens all RTP channels - the ones that are DRM encrypted and the ones that aren't.

## 👍 Recommended specs for Android TV boxes

For a good experience you need a device with decent SoC and enough RAM. As a general rule avoid SoCs made by Rockchip and Allwinner.

- **SoC**: Amlogic S905Y5, S905X5M or S905X5 (fast, energy efficient and supports the modern AV1 video codec)
- **RAM**: 4 GB
- **Firmware**: [slimBOXtv (ATV version)](https://slimboxtv.ru/)

Affordable Android TV boxes with Amlogic SoCs are usually much better supported than the ones powered by Rockchip or Allwinner.

You can buy an [excellent device](https://m3upt.com/x88-pro-x5m) for less than 50 euros on the recommended shopping websites.

If you prefer a TV Box already configured and ready to use, you can buy it [here](https://m3upt.com/tvbox).
