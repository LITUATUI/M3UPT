## 👍 Recommended specs for Android TV boxes

For a good experience you need a device with decent SoC and enough RAM. As a general rule avoid SoCs made by Rockchip and Allwinner.

- **SoC**: Amlogic S905W2, S905Y4, S905X4 or S928X (fast, energy efficient and supports the modern AV1 video codec)
- **RAM**: 4 GB
- **Internal storage**: 64 GB
- **Firmware**: [slimBOXtv (ATV version)](https://slimboxtv.ru/)

Affordable Android TV boxes with Amlogic SoCs are usually much better supported than the ones powered by Rockchip or Allwinner.

You can buy an excellent device for less than 40 euros on the recommended shopping websites.

If you prefer a TV Box already configured and ready to use, you can buy it [here](https://m3upt.com/tvbox).
